# Addendum to Sub-Task 1 (Agent D - Backend Orchestration) - Solution Summary Requirement
**Date of Addendum:** 2023-10-27
*(Timestamp is illustrative)*
**Original Task ID(s) Affected:** All tasks involving `run_llm_on_branch.py` and `parallelTaskManager.js` from Agent D's original Sub-Task 1 plan.

This addendum outlines modifications required to incorporate the generation and handling of "Solution Summaries" by the LLM agents.

**1. Modifications to `run_llm_on_branch.py`:**

*   **LLM Prompting:** The system prompt or the task-specific prompt sent to the LLM needs to be augmented. It should now include an instruction like:
    `"In addition to generating the code/files for this task, please also provide a concise summary (e.g., 2-3 paragraphs in Markdown format) describing your approach, the solution you've implemented, and any key files you created or modified. Save this summary to a file named 'solution_summary.md' in the root of your working directory."`
*   **Summary Handling (in Python script):**
    *   Upon successful completion of the LLM's work:
        *   The script must check for the existence of `solution_summary.md`.
        *   If it exists, its content should be read.
        *   The content of this summary must be included in the JSON payload of the "completed" status message sent to `main.js`. A new field, e.g., `solutionSummary: "content..."`, should be added to the payload.
            ```python
            # Example snippet for run_llm_on_branch.py
            solution_summary_content = None
            summary_filename = "solution_summary.md"
            if os.path.exists(summary_filename):
                with open(summary_filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                    solution_summary_content = f.read()
                logger.info(f"Read solution summary from {summary_filename}.")
            else:
                logger.warn(f"{summary_filename} not found.")

            # Add to report_status call for "completed" status:
            # solutionSummary=solution_summary_content
            ```
    *   The `solution_summary.md` file should be included in the list of files committed to the agent's branch.

**2. Modifications to `parallelTaskManager.js` Data Structures:**

*   The `AgentTask` object structure (managed within `activeRuns` in `parallelTaskManager.js`) must be updated to include a new nullable string field: `solutionSummary`.
    ```javascript
    // AgentTask Object Structure in parallelTaskManager.js (addition)
    // solutionSummary: (string, nullable)
    ```
*   The `handleIncomingMessage` function in `parallelTaskManager.js` must be updated to populate this new field when a "completed" message with `solutionSummary` is received from the Python script.
    ```javascript
    // Inside handleIncomingMessage, for message.status === "completed"
    // agentTask.solutionSummary = message.solutionSummary || null;
    ```

**Reason for Change:**
To provide a richer, more user-friendly preview of an agent's work in the UI, by displaying the agent's own description of its solution alongside the generated code/files. This refinement was requested by the Project Manager to replace Git diffs with a more direct view of the agent's output and rationale.
