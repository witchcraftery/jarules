# Archived Sub-Task for Agent E - Final Summary & Dependencies
## From Main Task: TASKID-20231027-120000-AGE-UIFORM - Implement UI for Task Definition & Agent Selection (Phase 2.5)

---
**Final Summary for Sub-Task 2 (UI for Task Definition & Agent Selection):**
**Date:** 2023-10-27

The simulated implementation of all Vue.js components (`TaskDefinitionInput.vue`, `SubAgentSelector.vue`, and `ParallelTaskLauncher.vue` including LLM config fetching and task submission logic) is now complete as per the detailed plan.

**Key Dependencies for this UI to be fully functional:**
1.  **IPC Channel `'get-llm-configs'`:** A handler in `main.js` that reads `llm_config.yaml` and returns the configurations in the expected array format. (Likely Agent G)
2.  **IPC Channel `'start-parallel-git-task'`:** A handler in `main.js` for this call, which should interface with `parallelTaskManager.js` (from Sub-Task 1 by Agent D) to initiate the backend processes. The handler must return a `result` object with `{ success: boolean, runId?: string, error?: string, details?: string }`. (Likely Agent G for IPC setup, Agent D for backend processing).

All UI-side logic and component structure designs are documented above.

**Verification Steps / Simulated Tests (Retroactively Added):**
*(Agent E would have defined how to verify this component's/logic's design against acceptance criteria. E.g., "1. Confirm props and emits match parent component's needs. 2. Verify `v-model` logic is correctly described. 3. Simulate IPC call and check expected payload/response structure.")*
