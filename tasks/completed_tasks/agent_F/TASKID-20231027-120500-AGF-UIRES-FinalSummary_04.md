# Archived Sub-Task for Agent F - Final Summary for Sub-Task 3
## From Main Task: TASKID-20231027-120500-AGF-UIRES - Implement UI for Results Preview & Finalization (Phase 2.5) - Revised for Solution Summaries

---
**Final Summary for Sub-Task 3 (UI for Results Preview & Finalization - Revised for Solution Summaries):**
**Date:** 2023-10-28

The simulated implementation of all planned Vue.js components (`ParallelTaskMonitor.vue`, `SubAgentProgressCard.vue`, and `AgentOutputViewer.vue`) for displaying agent solution summaries, code files, and handling task controls (including 'Download Zip') is now complete as per the revised detailed plan.

**Key Dependencies for this UI to be fully functional:**
1.  **Agent D (Backend - Sub-Task 1 Addenda):**
    *   `run_llm_on_branch.py` must provide `solutionSummary` content and `keyFilePaths` list in its 'completed' status update.
    *   Backend logic for the new Python script/utility to zip agent branch content must be implemented.
    *   `parallelTaskManager.js` must be updated to handle `solutionSummary`, `keyFilePaths`, and the new `handleTriggerAgentVersionZip` function.
2.  **Agent G (IPC - Sub-Task 4 Revisions):**
    *   IPC Channel `'get-agent-task-outputs'`: Must be implemented to fetch `solutionSummary` and `keyFilePaths` (and/or file contents).
    *   IPC Channel `'trigger-agent-version-zip'`: Must be implemented to trigger zipping and return a download path.
    *   IPC Channel `'get-parallel-run-status'`: Recommended for robust initial loading of `ParallelTaskMonitor.vue`.
    *   `'parallel-git-task-update'` event payload for "completed" tasks needs to include `solutionSummaryAvailable` and `keyFiles` list.

All UI-side logic and component structure designs for Sub-Task 3 are documented above. The UI anticipates a Markdown-to-HTML rendering library for solution summaries and initially uses `<pre>` tags for code viewing.
