### Task ID: TASKID-20231027-120500-AGF-UIRES
**Assigned:** 2023-10-27 12:05:00 UTC
**Status:** New
**Title:** Implement UI for Results Preview & Finalization (Phase 2.5)

**Description:**
Develop the Vue.js components that allow users to monitor the progress of parallel sub-agent tasks, preview their results, select a preferred version, and finalize it (e.g., by creating a Pull Request).

Key Requirements:
1.  **Progress Monitoring UI:** Display status/progress of each sub-agent via `'parallel-git-task-update'` IPC.
2.  **Results Preview Area:** Show summaries, diffs, or file links for completed agent tasks. Allow switching between agent results.
3.  **Version Selection & Finalization:** UI to select a preferred version and trigger `window.api.finalizeSelectedGitVersion` IPC.
4.  **Task Control UI:** Buttons to retry (`window.api.retryAgentGitTask`) or cancel (`window.api.cancelParallelRun`).
5.  **Overall Run Status:** Listen to `'parallel-git-run-completed'` for final run status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can see a list of active sub-agents for a run, with their individual statuses updating in real-time.
- User can view a summary/diff of results for each completed sub-agent.
- User can select one sub-agent's result as the preferred version.
- User can trigger "finalize" action, which correctly calls the `finalizeSelectedGitVersion` IPC with `runId` and `selectedAgentId`.
- User can trigger "retry" for a specific agent, calling the `retryAgentGitTask` IPC.
- User can trigger "cancel" for the entire run, calling the `cancelParallelRun` IPC.
- UI correctly reflects the overall status of the run based on IPC events.

**Notes/Plans by Agent F:**
*(Please add your detailed implementation plan for these Vue components here, including component structure, props, data, methods, and specific IPC interactions for displaying results and controlling tasks.)*
