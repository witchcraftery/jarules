### Task ID: TASKID-20231027-120500-AGF-UIRES
**Assigned:** 2023-10-27 12:05:00 UTC
**Status:** Completed
**Completed On:** 2023-10-28 21:00:00 UTC
**Title:** Implement UI for Results Preview & Finalization (Phase 2.5) - *Revised for Solution Summaries*

**Description:**
Develop the Vue.js components that allow users to monitor the progress of parallel sub-agent tasks, preview their results (focusing on agent-generated solution summaries and direct code file viewing), select a preferred version, and finalize it (e.g., by creating a Pull Request).

Key Requirements:
1.  **Progress Monitoring UI:** Display status/progress of each sub-agent via `'parallel-git-task-update'` IPC.
2.  **Results Preview Area:** For a selected completed agent, display its **self-generated solution summary** prominently. Below or alongside the summary, provide a way to view the content of key **code files** created/modified by the agent. Allow switching between agent results.
3.  **Version Selection & Finalization:** UI to select a preferred version (based on summary and code review) and trigger `window.api.finalizeSelectedGitVersion` IPC.
4.  **Task Control UI:** Buttons to retry (`window.api.retryAgentGitTask`) or cancel (`window.api.cancelParallelRun`).
5.  **Overall Run Status:** Listen to `'parallel-git-run-completed'` for final run status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can see a list of active sub-agents for a run, with their individual statuses updating in real-time.
- User can view the **agent's self-generated solution summary** and the content of **key code files** for each completed sub-agent.
- User can select one sub-agent's result as the preferred version.
- User can trigger "finalize" action, which correctly calls the `finalizeSelectedGitVersion` IPC with `runId` and `selectedAgentId`.
- User can trigger "retry" for a specific agent, calling the `retryAgentGitTask` IPC.
- User can trigger "cancel" for the entire run, calling the `cancelParallelRun` IPC.
- UI correctly reflects the overall status of the run based on IPC events.

**High-Level Implementation Plan (Original - Revised for Solution Summaries):**

**Overall Goal:** Develop Vue.js components to enable users to monitor parallel sub-agent tasks, preview their results (solution summary + code files), select a preferred version, and trigger actions like finalization, retry, or cancellation via IPC calls.

**I. Main Orchestrating Component: `ParallelTaskMonitor.vue`**
    (Handles overall run view, sub-agent card iteration, and hosts `AgentOutputViewer`. Manages IPC listeners for run/task updates and triggers high-level actions like cancel run/retry agent.)
**II. Sub-Component: `SubAgentProgressCard.vue`**
    (Displays individual agent status, progress, and buttons for 'View Output', 'Retry', 'Select for Finalize'.)
**III. Sub-Component: `AgentOutputViewer.vue`**
    (Displays selected agent's solution summary (HTML rendered) and key code files (selectable, content in `<pre>`). Includes 'Download Zip' and 'Use This Solution' buttons. Fetches data via `'get-agent-task-outputs'`.)
**IV. IPC Channel Adjustments**
    (Relies on existing IPCs plus new `'get-agent-task-outputs'` and `'trigger-agent-version-zip'`. Notes payload requirements for `'parallel-git-task-update'`.)

*(End of Original High-Level Plan Sections I-IV)*

**Key Decisions & Rationale:**
- Focus on displaying solution summaries and raw code content.
- On-demand loading of file contents in `AgentOutputViewer.vue`.
- Initial code display with `<pre>` tags; Markdown summary rendered as HTML.
- `AgentProgressData` to indicate summary/key file availability.

**Open Questions for Lead:**
- Key code files determined by LLM output.
- Markdown summary rendered using an HTML library.

**Dependencies:**
- Agent D (Backend): For `solution_summary.md` generation, key file listing, `'get-agent-task-outputs'` logic, zipping functionality.
- Agent G (IPC): For `'get-agent-task-outputs'`, `'trigger-agent-version-zip'`, other IPCs, and ensuring correct payloads.

**Verification Steps / Simulated Tests (Retroactively Added):**
*(Agent F would have outlined checks such as: 1. `ParallelTaskMonitor` subscribes to and correctly updates from IPC events. 2. `AgentOutputViewer` correctly fetches and displays summary and code files. 3. All action buttons trigger correct IPC calls with correct payloads.)*
