### Task ID: TASKID-20231027-121000-AGG-IPCIF
**Assigned:** 2023-10-27 12:10:00 UTC
**Status:** Completed
**Completed On:** 2023-10-28 22:00:00 UTC
**Title:** Implement IPC Interface for Parallel Tasks (Phase 2.5) - *Revised for Solution Previews & Zipping*

**Description:**
Ensure robust and correct implementation of all client-side (renderer, via `preload.js`) and main-process side (`main.js`) aspects of the IPC channels dedicated to the parallel Git task functionality. This interface is the backbone for communication between the UI and the backend orchestration logic, supporting solution summary/code previews and on-demand zipping of agent versions. Reference `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` and `development-status.md` for detailed payload structures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All specified `window.api` functions are available in the renderer process via `preload.js`.
- `main.js` correctly handles IPC calls, invoking appropriate logic in `parallelTaskManager.js` (from Agent D's Sub-Task 1, including its addenda).
- `main.js` handlers return asynchronous responses with correct payload structures as defined in `development-status.md` and this task.
    - `'get-agent-task-outputs'` returns solution summary, key file paths, and optionally file contents.
    - `'trigger-agent-version-zip'` returns success status and a temporary download path for the zip file.
- Renderer can successfully register callbacks for `onParallelGitTaskUpdate` and `onParallelGitRunCompleted`.
- `'parallel-git-task-update'` event for "completed" tasks correctly includes `solutionSummary` and `keyFilePaths` in its payload.
- `main.js` (via `parallelTaskManager.js`) correctly emits all Main-to-Renderer events with specified payloads.
- `cleanupParallelTaskListeners` function correctly removes listeners.
- Robust error handling for IPC communication failures or invalid payloads.

**High-Level Implementation Plan (Original - Revised):**
*   **I. General Setup and Conventions** (Details archived to: `tasks/completed_tasks/agent_G/TASKID-20231027-121000-AGG-IPCIF-GeneralSetup_01.md`)
*   **II. Renderer-to-Main IPC Calls (Invoke/Handle Pattern)** (Details archived to: `tasks/completed_tasks/agent_G/TASKID-20231027-121000-AGG-IPCIF-RendererToMainIPCs_02.md`)
*   **III. Main-to-Renderer Event Emitters** (Details archived to: `tasks/completed_tasks/agent_G/TASKID-20231027-121000-AGG-IPCIF-MainToRendererEvents_03.md`)
*   **IV. Listener Cleanup Functionality** (Details archived to: `tasks/completed_tasks/agent_G/TASKID-20231027-121000-AGG-IPCIF-MainToRendererEvents_03.md`)

**Key Decisions & Rationale:**

**Open Questions for Lead:**
*(Details archived to: `tasks/completed_tasks/agent_G/TASKID-20231027-121000-AGG-IPCIF-PlanSummaryDecisions_04.md` - Resolution noted: Current plan for zip download confirmed).*

**Dependencies:**
*(Details archived to: `tasks/completed_tasks/agent_G/TASKID-20231027-121000-AGG-IPCIF-PlanSummaryDecisions_04.md`)*

**Verification Steps / Simulated Tests (Retroactively Added):**
*(Agent G would have defined how to verify each IPC channel, payload, and interaction. E.g., "1. Test `startParallelGitTask` IPC call with valid/invalid payloads. 2. Verify `onParallelGitTaskUpdate` event structure for 'completed' status, ensuring `solutionSummary` and `keyFilePaths` are present.")*

**Simulated Implementation Details:**
*The detailed simulated implementation (actual IPC code in `preload.js` and `main.js` handlers) for each part of this task has been granularly archived to `tasks/completed_tasks/agent_G/` under files prefixed with `TASKID-20231027-121000-AGG-IPCIF-`.
