### Task ID: TASKID-20231027-120000-AGE-UIFORM
**Assigned:** 2023-10-27 12:00:00 UTC
**Status:** Completed
**Completed On:** 2023-10-28 20:00:00 UTC
**Title:** Implement UI for Task Definition & Agent Selection (Phase 2.5)

**Description:**
Develop Vue.js components for the Electron application to allow users to:
1.  Input a detailed task prompt.
2.  Select multiple LLM sub-agents from a dynamically populated list (fetched via IPC from `llm_config.yaml`).
3.  Initiate the parallel Git-split task by sending the prompt and selected agent configurations to the main process via the `window.api.startParallelGitTask(taskDetails)` IPC call.

This involves creating:
*   `ParallelTaskLauncher.vue`: Main orchestrating component.
*   `TaskDefinitionInput.vue`: For the task prompt.
*   `SubAgentSelector.vue`: For LLM agent selection.

Key considerations include component structure, state management, fetching LLM configs, constructing the `taskDetails` payload accurately, and user feedback mechanisms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can type a multi-line task description.
- User can see a list of available LLM configurations (name, provider, model).
- User can select one or more LLM configurations.
- "Submit Task" button is enabled only when a prompt is entered and at least one agent is selected.
- Clicking "Submit Task" correctly calls `window.api.startParallelGitTask` with a `taskDetails` payload matching the structure in `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (including `taskDescription` and an array of `selectedAgents` objects with `id`, `name`, `provider`, `model`).
- Basic loading state and success/error feedback messages are displayed to the user after submission attempt.
- The list of available LLMs for selection is fetched from the main process (representing `llm_config.yaml`).

**High-Level Implementation Plan (Original):**

**Overall Goal:** Create Vue.js components to enable users to define a task, select multiple LLM sub-agents, and initiate a parallel Git-split task via an IPC call.

**I. Component Structure & Placement**
1.  `TaskDefinitionInput.vue` (`src/components/TaskDefinitionInput.vue`)
2.  `SubAgentSelector.vue` (`src/components/SubAgentSelector.vue`)
3.  `ParallelTaskLauncher.vue` (`src/components/ParallelTaskLauncher.vue`) - Main orchestrator.

**II. `TaskDefinitionInput.vue` - Detailed Design Summary**
    (Props: `modelValue`; Emits: `update:modelValue`; Template: label & textarea)

**III. `SubAgentSelector.vue` - Detailed Design Summary**
    (Props: `availableAgents`, `modelValue`; Emits: `update:modelValue`; Data: `internalSelectedAgentIds`; Template: list with checkboxes; Methods: selection logic, select/deselect all; Watch: `modelValue`)

**IV. `ParallelTaskLauncher.vue` - Detailed Design Summary**
    (Data: `taskPrompt`, `allAvailableLLMAgents`, `selectedLLMAgents`, loading/feedback states; IPC for LLM Configs: `'get-llm-configs'`; Template: integrates inputs, selector, submit button, feedback; Computed: `isFormValid`; Methods: `submitParallelTask` with IPC call to `startParallelGitTask`)

**V. Styling and UX Enhancements**
    (Consistent styling, responsive, clear feedback)

*(End of Original High-Level Plan)*

**Key Decisions & Rationale:**
*(Refer to archived details for specific decisions made during initial planning by Agent E.)*
- Decision: Detailed component breakdown as above.
- Rationale: Modularity and `v-model` for reusability.

**Open Questions for Lead:**
*(Refer to archived details for specific questions raised during initial planning by Agent E.)*
- Initial Question: Confirmation of IPC channel for LLM configs (Resolved: `'get-llm-configs'`).

**Dependencies:**
*(Refer to archived details for specific dependencies listed during initial planning by Agent E.)*
- IPC Channel: `'get-llm-configs'` (Provided by Agent G).
- IPC Channel: `'start-parallel-git-task'` (Provided by Agent G, Backend by Agent D).

**Verification Steps / Simulated Tests (Retroactively Added):**
*(Agent E would have defined how to verify each component's design against acceptance criteria. E.g., "1. Confirm `TaskDefinitionInput` props/emits. 2. Verify `SubAgentSelector` selection logic. 3. Check `ParallelTaskLauncher` payload construction for IPC.")*
