# Implementation Guide

This document provides guidance for ongoing development tasks, particularly those that may require manual intervention or were complex to achieve with current tooling.

## Phase: LLM Configuration and Management System (November 2023 - Current)

**Objective**: To introduce a flexible system for managing multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrate the existing Gemini client into this new architecture.

### Completed Changes:

1.  **`config/llm_config.yaml` Created**:
    *   A new YAML file defining configurations for LLMs.
    *   Includes functional settings for `GeminiClient` (e.g., `gemini_flash_default`).
    *   Contains placeholder structures for future Ollama and OpenRouter integrations.
    *   Supports unique IDs, provider types, model names, API key environment variable names, default system prompts, and generation parameters.

2.  **`jarules_agent/core/llm_manager.py` Implemented**:
    *   New `LLMManager` class that loads and parses `llm_config.yaml`.
    *   Provides `get_llm_connector(config_id)` method to instantiate and return LLM connector instances based on configuration.
    *   Currently supports instantiating `GeminiClient`.
    *   Includes caching for loaded connectors and error handling for configuration issues.

3.  **`jarules_agent/connectors/gemini_api.py` Adapted**:
    *   `GeminiClient` constructor (`__init__`) updated to accept `api_key`, `default_system_prompt`, and `generation_params` directly.
    *   Prioritizes passed-in API key over environment variables.
    *   Uses configured default system prompts and generation parameters if no overriding values are provided in method calls.

4.  **`jarules_agent/ui/cli.py` Integrated with `LLMManager`**:
    *   CLI now instantiates `LLMManager`.
    *   Retrieves the active LLM client (currently hardcoded to use the "gemini_flash_default" configuration) via `llm_manager.get_llm_connector()`.
    *   Updated error handling for LLM initialization.

5.  **`jarules_agent/tests/test_llm_manager.py` Created**:
    *   New test suite for `LLMManager`, covering configuration loading, connector instantiation (for Gemini), and error handling.

6.  **`jarules_agent/tests/test_gemini_api.py` Reviewed**:
    *   Existing tests reviewed and deemed largely compatible with changes to `GeminiClient.__init__` due to its fallback mechanisms for API key handling.
7.  **`jarules_agent/tests/test_cli.py` Updated (Manual Task)**:
    *   The test suite for the CLI (`test_cli.py`) was manually updated to align with the new `LLMManager` architecture. This involved refactoring test setup, mock strategies (changing from `GeminiClient` to `LLMManager`), and ensuring all AI command tests correctly simulate the CLI's interaction with the `LLMManager` for obtaining LLM connector instances. This task was completed manually due to previous issues with automated tooling for this specific file.
