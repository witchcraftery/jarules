## âœ… Recently Completed: Multi-LLM Expansion & CLI Switching (June 2025)

This phase focused on extending the agent's capabilities to support a variety of LLM providers and allowing users to manage their active model choice via the CLI.

-   **Ollama Integration**: Enables connection to local LLMs managed by Ollama, allowing for offline and customized model usage.
-   **OpenRouter Connector**: Provides access to a wide variety of models (including GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.) via the OpenRouter API, simplifying the use of diverse cloud-based models.
-   **Anthropic Claude Integration**: Supports Claude models (e.g., Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) via the official Anthropic SDK, enabling access to their advanced reasoning and generation capabilities.
-   **Runtime Model Switching & Persistence**: Implemented CLI commands (`set-model <id>`, `get-model`, `clear-model`) allowing users to dynamically switch the active LLM provider. User selections are persisted in `~/.jarules/user_state.json`.

### Electron UI - Phase 1: Core Chat Experience Enhancements
This initial phase for the desktop UI focused on creating a functional chat interface with essential features for interacting with the configured LLM providers.

-   **Functional Electron UI Shell**: Established a base Electron application using Vue.js and Vite (`jarules_electron_vue_ui/`) with secure IPC (contextBridge, preload scripts) and Python backend integration via `python-shell` and dedicated wrapper scripts.
-   **Streaming LLM Responses**: Implemented real-time display of LLM responses as they are generated in the chat interface, enhancing perceived responsiveness.
-   **Chat History Management**: Added functionality to load chat history from, and save new messages to, `~/.jarules/chat_history.json`. Users can also clear the chat history via a UI button.
-   **Refined Message Display & Input**:
    *   Created `MessageDisplay.vue` component for rendering chat messages. This includes Markdown support for assistant responses and distinct styling for user, assistant, and error messages. It also handles auto-scrolling.
    *   Created `ChatInput.vue` component for user input, featuring an auto-resizing textarea and support for send-on-Enter (Shift+Enter for newlines).
-   **Robust Error Handling & User Feedback**: Implemented a global error banner for critical backend or IPC issues, loading state indicators for asynchronous operations (model/history loading), and a "Copy to Clipboard" feature for assistant messages.

These additions significantly enhance the flexibility and power of the JaRules agent, bringing its capabilities to a user-friendly desktop interface.

## ðŸš€ Next Development Phase: Electron UI Enhancements & Advanced Agent Features

**Status**: Core Multi-LLM capabilities and foundational Electron UI (Phase 1) are complete. This next phase focuses on enriching the Electron application with more advanced user interactions, backend integrations, and preparing for broader agent capabilities.

### Electron UI - Phase 2: Advanced Features & Foolproofing
This phase aims to integrate more sophisticated interactions and robust operational checks into the Electron UI.

*   âœ… **Context Management System (Basic)**: (Completed July 2025)
    *   Implemented logic to automatically send the last N messages (default 10, configurable via `user_state.json` by setting `context_message_count`) from `~/.jarules/chat_history.json` as context to the LLM.
    *   The number of messages is determined by `context_message_count` in `user_state.json`, falling back to a default of 10 if the setting is not present or invalid.
    *   Existing "Clear Chat History" functionality in the UI effectively clears/resets this context as it empties `chat_history.json`.
*   **In-App Configuration UI (Read-Only First)**:
    *   Create a UI section to display the contents of `llm_config.yaml` in a user-friendly, read-only format.
    *   This helps users understand available models and their configurations without directly editing YAML.
    *   (Future editable configuration will be a separate, more complex feature).
*   **"Stop Generation" Functionality**:
    *   Add a button to allow users to interrupt an in-progress LLM response stream.
    *   This will require IPC communication to signal the Python backend (and `PythonShell` instance) to terminate the LLM call if possible, or at least stop forwarding chunks.
*   **Pre-flight Checks / Diagnostics**:
    *   Implement a system within the Electron app to verify essential backend components:
        *   Python environment accessibility and `python-shell` compatibility.
        *   Connectivity to active LLM provider (using `check_availability` from the connector).
        *   Basic syntax validation of `llm_config.yaml` and `user_state.json`.
    *   Display results in a dedicated diagnostics panel or on startup, guiding users to troubleshoot common issues.

### Electron UI - Phase 2.5: Asynchronous Git-Split Task Completion
This phase introduces a novel approach to task execution by leveraging Git branches for parallel sub-agent work.

*   **Objective**: Allow users to assign a complex prompt/task to multiple "sub-agents" (instances or configurations of LLMs) that work in parallel on separate Git branches based on the current repository state.
*   **Key Interactions**:
    *   User defines a task and selects multiple LLM configurations (sub-agents) to attempt the task.
    *   The system creates a new Git branch for each sub-agent.
    *   Each sub-agent attempts to complete the task, committing its results (code, text, etc.) to its dedicated branch.
    *   The UI provides a way for the user to preview the changes (diffs, generated files, visual outputs if applicable) from each sub-agent's completed branch.
*   **Outcome**: User reviews the parallel attempts and selects the preferred version. This version is then used to create a new Pull Request against the main working branch (or directly merged if preferred). Other sub-agent branches are automatically discarded/cleaned up.
*   **Core Components**:
    *   UI for task assignment, sub-agent selection, progress monitoring, and result preview/comparison.
    *   Backend logic for orchestrating multiple LLM agent calls in parallel.
    *   Robust Git integration for branch creation, file management, commits, diff generation, and cleanup (likely using `gitpython` or direct CLI calls from Python).
    *   Logic for PR creation (e.g., via GitHub API connector).

### Electron UI - Phase 3: Polish & Packaging
This phase focuses on refining the user experience, ensuring stability, and preparing the application for distribution.

*   **Comprehensive UI Styling and Theming**:
    *   Implement a polished and consistent visual design across the application.
    *   Explore and add theme options (e.g., light/dark mode).
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Introduce keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., send prompt, switch models, clear history).
*   **Thorough Testing & Bug Fixing**: Conduct extensive testing of all UI features, backend integrations, and error handling paths. Address identified bugs and performance issues.
*   **Build and Test Packaged Application**:
    *   Finalize `electron-builder` configurations for all target platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux).
    *   Build and rigorously test the packaged application installers/executables on each OS.
    *   Address any platform-specific issues.

### Advanced Agent Features (Parallel Track / Subsequent Focus)
These features aim to enhance the core intelligence and capabilities of the agent, running in parallel with UI development or as a subsequent major focus.

*   **Multi-step Task Execution & Planning**: Enable the agent to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps and execute them sequentially or in parallel where appropriate.
*   **Enhanced Context Management**: Move beyond simple history windowing to more sophisticated context understanding, possibly including summarization, entity extraction, and relevance scoring for context tokens.
*   **Tool Usage & Function Calling**: Integrate capabilities for the LLM to use external tools or call predefined functions to gather information or perform actions (e.g., run linters, execute code, search web).
*   **Knowledge Base Integration**: Allow the agent to connect to and query local or remote knowledge bases (e.g., vector databases, document stores) to augment its responses with specific information.

### Development Guidelines for New Connectors

**Follow Established Patterns**:
- Inherit from `BaseLLMConnector`. The `BaseLLMConnector` provides a standard interface (e.g., initialization with configuration, methods for logging) and ensures that all connectors adhere to core operational principles within the `LLMManager`.
- Implement all required methods: `generate_code()`, `explain_code()`, `suggest_code_modification()`.
  - **Flexibility Note**: If a provider offers unique functionalities that don't fit these methods, consider adding optional methods to the connector. For functionalities that are variations of existing methods, use parameters to control behavior. Discuss significant deviations with the team to maintain consistency.
- Use configuration from `llm_config.yaml`.
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exception classes. Define custom exceptions for provider-specific API errors or configuration issues (e.g., `OllamaApiError`, `ClaudeConfigurationError`) inheriting from a base `ConnectorError` if appropriate.

**API Key Management**:
- **Security Best Practice**: API keys for cloud providers must NOT be hardcoded in `llm_config.yaml` or checked into version control.
- **Recommended Approach**: Load API keys from environment variables (e.g., `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). The connector's initialization logic should fetch keys from the environment. Consider supporting a dedicated secrets management solution in the future if complexity grows.

**Testing Standards**:
- Follow the test patterns established in `test_gemini_api.py`.
- **Minimum 40+ test cases** covering all scenarios, including various input types, successful calls, API error responses (e.g., authentication failure, model not found), configuration issues, and specific edge cases relevant to the provider.
  - **Example Edge Case**: Handling API rate limits gracefully or parsing malformed/unexpected responses from the API.
- Environment variable patching **before** client initialization (especially for API keys and endpoint configurations).
- Mock setup for API interactions, specific to each provider's API.
- Error handling and edge case coverage.
- **Note**: The recently added Ollama, OpenRouter, and Claude connectors serve as good examples for these guidelines.

**Configuration Integration**:
- Add provider configuration to `config/llm_config.yaml`. See example structure below.
- Support API keys (via environment variables primarily), default prompts, and generation parameters.
- Enable `LLMManager` automatic instantiation. The `LLMManager` is responsible for reading `llm_config.yaml`, discovering available provider configurations, and instantiating the appropriate connector on demand.

**Example `config/llm_config.yaml` Structure**:
```yaml
# config/llm_config.yaml

# Gemini Configuration (existing)
gemini:
  api_key: "GEMINI_API_KEY" # Loaded from env var if possible
  default_model: "gemini-pro"
  # ... other Gemini specific settings

# Ollama Connector Configuration
ollama:
  base_url: "http://localhost:11434"
  default_model: "llama3"
  request_timeout: 120 # Example: specific parameter for Ollama

# OpenRouter Connector Configuration
openrouter:
  # API key should be loaded from OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
  default_model: "openai/gpt-4o"
  # ... other OpenRouter specific settings

# Anthropic Claude Connector Configuration
anthropic:
  # API key should be loaded from ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
  default_model: "claude-3-opus-20240229"
  # ... other Anthropic specific settings

# Default provider to use if not specified by the user
default_provider: "gemini"
```
