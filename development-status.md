# Development Status & Project Dashboard

This document tracks the overall development status, current priorities, feature progress, and key integration points for the JaRules project.

## Overall Project Status

*   **Current Focus:** Electron UI - Phase 2.5: Asynchronous Git-Split Task Completion.
*   **Next Up:** Electron UI - Phase 3: Polish & Packaging, Advanced Agent Features.
*   **Overall Health:** Green (Active development, new workflow process being implemented).

## Current Priorities (as of YYYY-MM-DD)
*(To be updated by Lead Planner/User)*

1.  Complete planning for all sub-tasks of "Electron UI - Phase 2.5".
2.  Begin (simulated) implementation of Phase 2.5 sub-tasks in order, starting with backend/core logic.
3.  Refine and solidify the new task management and documentation workflow.
