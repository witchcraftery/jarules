# Development Status & Project Dashboard

This document tracks the overall development status, current priorities, feature progress, and key integration points for the JaRules project.

## Overall Project Status

*   **Current Focus:** Electron UI - Phase 2.5: Asynchronous Git-Split Task Completion.
*   **Next Up:** Electron UI - Phase 3: Polish & Packaging, Advanced Agent Features.
*   **Overall Health:** Green (Active development, new workflow process being implemented).
*   **Key Process Update:** LLM Sub-Agents performing tasks (especially code generation/modification) are now required to produce a `solution_summary.md` file describing their approach and solution. This summary will be displayed in the UI.
    *   **Decision:** LLM agents are responsible for listing the key files they create/modify (as part of their summary or structured output).
    *   **Decision:** UI (Agent F) will use a Markdown-to-HTML library to render these summaries.
    *   **New Feature:** A "Download Agent Version as Zip" functionality will be added to the results preview UI.
    *   **Decision (Zip Download Flow):** The `'trigger-agent-version-zip'` IPC will return a temporary `downloadPath` and `filename` to the renderer. The renderer will then call a separate generic main process utility (e.g., `window.electron.requestFileDownload(path, filename)`) to initiate the OS download dialog.


## Current Priorities (as of YYYY-MM-DD)
*(To be updated by Lead Planner/User)*

1.  Finalize planning for all sub-tasks of "Electron UI - Phase 2.5".
2.  Formally approve plans for Agent F (Sub-Task 3) and Agent G (Sub-Task 4).
3.  Begin (simulated) implementation of Phase 2.5 sub-tasks, prioritizing Agent D (Backend), then Agent G (IPC), then Agent F (UI).


## Feature/Phase Status
